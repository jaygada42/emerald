title: What's bothering you?

If you know me and if we have stayed up late texting each other on Whatsapp several times, you have probably come across this question before. In the conversation that follows, some of you fill me in with the details of your fears and anxiety. Others, however, choose to dismiss the question. What I infer from this is that either nothing bothers you enough to talk about it or you are averse to opening up to people. Or maybe you would like talking about it, just not with me. 

But one thing is true, whether you like to admit it or not, that we all the going through a crisis. For some of us, it has just arrived and for others, it has stayed for a while now. I’m not doing very well myself these days. But I know I’ll be okay. One step at a time. Sometimes bearing it is all we can do with pain or anxiety. Surviving it, in whatever way possible. But there are no tools that are off-limits in our trial of getting better. Some of us choose to pen it down, this anxiety we feel, on a piece of paper or a diary. Some of us try to get it out through art. Some pick up a lost hobby while others even turn to alcohol and drugs. But sometimes these tools aren’t enough to express your emotions with the intensity you need to in order to feel better.
Just a couple of days ago, I was in a mall. On a regular day, the scent of the mall would make my brain flood with dopamine but it didn’t that day, for some reason. I was lost amidst clothes and shoes, trying to locate my mother. A salesperson walked up to me and asked, “Can I help you?”. There was nothing remarkable about those words but it instantly put me at ease. I felt cared for. The thing about human interaction is, you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to, because socializing is not an obligation but sometimes it can affect you beyond your imagination.

Amidst all the debates that we have amongst ourselves about the raging issues the modern world is facing, somewhere, the human interaction at an emotional level is lost. We meet our friends and discuss everything ranging from politics to climate change to a movie that recently released. But we never talk about our passing worries, or our insecurities, the things that should actually be talked about. This very human interaction is the tool that works the best for anxiety because it’s a change for the better. Yes, we have been through hard times. Life hasn’t always been fair to us. And yes, we deserve financial security and a hopeful future, even love. But most importantly, we deserve to be heard. We deserve to be asked “How do you feel today?” “Is something bothering you?” in a way that we can answer with absolute honesty. 

I always walk up to people who I love and who, I feel, care enough to listen to me with an open mind. And I sincerely feel you should too. I am not saying it can make your problems disappear magically, but it’s comforting nonetheless. And if you ever think you have nobody, feel free to reach out and we can talk about our issues. I’ll listen to what’s bothering you, if you will too.
